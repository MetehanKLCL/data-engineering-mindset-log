# Data Engineering Mindset Log

This repository documents my daily practice of analyzing real-world
data engineering problems with a production-oriented mindset.

## Objective
To strengthen my data engineering thinking by focusing on:
- system design trade-offs
- data reliability
- incremental and scalable data processing

Rather than tool-heavy tutorials, this repository emphasizes **why**
certain decisions are made in production data systems.

## What You'll Find Here
- **Daily Cases:** Realistic data engineering scenarios with analysis and minimal working solutions
- **Applied Projects:** How these concepts are applied to my own projects
- **Knowledge Base:** Structured notes on core data engineering concepts

## Target Role
Junior / Early Mid Data Engineer

## Key Focus Areas
- Incremental & CDC-style pipelines
- Idempotent data processing
- Data quality & failure handling
- Distributed systems fundamentals

Each case includes:
- problem definition
- engineering analysis
- trade-offs
- minimal SQL / Python examples
- real-world application notes
